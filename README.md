We had some issues with this project primarily regarding classifying the trail difficulty by elevation. We learned that the "trails" and contours were of two different types making joining and casting difficult. After several attempts to debug we instead decided to map the elevation layer to a color palette to indicate the changes in elevation. The lengend for the vegetation layer was hard to properly construct as well as removing it when the vegetation layer box was not clicked. The vegetation layer itself can be removed but not the lengend.
